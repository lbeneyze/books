# Introduction
This page contains an overview of books that I have read and/or are planning to read.

I love reading and I'm disappointed that I don't have (take) time to read more. When I started with my own company in 2007, I realised that you have to learn your entire life if you want to progress. "Progress" doesn't mean to be the best, it means to gain new insights, to sense the world better.
Next to the many online courses, continuously reading is big part of my lifelong learning journey. 

The ratings below are my personal ratings, based on how I experienced the book and how relevant it is to my day-to-day life.

# Contribute

It starts by developping a strategy that provides a clear vision, business goals to achieve, needs to be fulfilled for specific customers segments. In its early stage, the strategy is based on many assumptions. It is important to devote time with the team to validate those assumptions. After these research this could led to pivoting or even stopping. When the strategy is clear and product performance KPI have been defined, a product roadmap is defined. This product roadmap is a high level plan on how to achieve the strategy defined. Then the product backlog can be defined with epics and items to the realisation of the product. Each tool has a link and impact each other but should not be tightly as it reduces their flexibility. Depending on the level of uncertainties (product, market, technology, business model...), those tools should be worked out until the highest level of certainty and reviewed constantly with the knowledge acuqired along the journey. Fail/change fast is the motto here. Roman provides also in his book lots of useful template, tools and techniques to help a product owner/manager during this journey. Important is to go outside, to let you help by a multidisciplinary team and to remain objective.
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/412m6c12zBL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100"> | [INSPIRED: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love (Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507/), Marty Cagan, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | What a book! Marty Cagan in his book INSPIRED covers a broad scope of aspects on the creation of a technical software product creation process. This book is addressed in particular for Product Manager / Product Owner. There is a bunch of methods, references and tips but what I found the much valuable of this book, is the intention of Marty Cagan to teach you a mindset: data driven, experimental, trustworthy, courageous mindset instead of assuming, waterfally, controlling and orders-executing mindset. If you are ready to embrace those ideas then you are on your way creating great tech products that customers love!  
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iw9AITfbL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100"> |[Competing in the Age of AI: Strategy and Leadership When Algorithms and Networks Run the World](https://www.amazon.com/Competing-Age-AI-Leadership-Algorithms/dp/1633697622/), Marco Iansiti Karim R. Lakhani, ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | It wasn't an easy journey but I went to the end finally. In their book, Marco Iansiti and Karim R. Lakhani, explain how Artificial Intelligence has changed the economy orders with the rise of "hub" companies like Amazon, Ant Financial and how existing companies, as Microsoft, Apple or Adobe are getting along this change adopting the scalable to the infinity digital operation model. What I personally found very interesting are the concept of network and learning effects. Network effects describe the value added by increasing the number of connections within and across networks. Learning effects capture the value added by increasing the amount of data flowing through the same networks. The authors are using many examples to explain both concepts and how this make companies such as Amazon so powerful/successful. What I really like about this book is that it is business focused and show that technology is just a mean and not an end.
| <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PWIy1rHUL.jpg" width="100"> |[How to Win Friends & Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/B0006IU7JK/) , Dale Carnegie , ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This was my first audiobook. What a wonderful book! I have to admit that I was a bit sceptic based on the title of the book. But I really like it. It explained well what is needed to develop good relationships and why it is important to stay friendly and to develop empathy. For me, I realised the sad truth that people are only interested in themselves and this is the only thing that matters.
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51mN3bY0JjL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_FMwebp_.jpg" width="100"> |[The Subtle art of not giving a f*/ck](https://markmanson.net/books/subtle-art) , Mark Manson , ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Again a great book. This is my second audiobook. Based on the title, this is again a book that I won't read because I have to invest too much time. Very entertaining but also containing interesting elements. People gives in general a lot of meaning to different things, social forces, "forcing" them to behave in a specific ways. But what will happen if people stops responding to those forces? Through different examples Mark Manson explains why it is important to "not give a f*/ck"!
| <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51n-FVT8y1L.jpg" width="100"> |[Get Smart: How to Think and Act Like the Most Successful and Highest-Paid People in Every Field](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Smart-Successful-Highest-Paid-People/dp/0399183787/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1626850714&sr=8-7) , Brian Tracy , ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This is my third audiobook. For me this book is like self-fulfilling prophecy. Not that I am thinking and acting like successfull people or that I am successfull but because it is echoing what I think is needed to become successfull: work hard, plan ahead, be disciplined!
| <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51j1P236E3L.jpg" width="100"> |[The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Hard-Things-audiobook/dp/B00I0A6HUO/ref=sr_1_1?crid=13BAZEJEKO72A&dchild=1&keywords=the+hard+things+about+hard+things&qid=1626850944&sprefix=the+hard+things%2Caps%2C892&sr=8-1) , Ben Horowitz , ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This is my fourth audiobook. I listened to this book because it was named as one of the best management book to be read. And I'm really glad I read it. Ben Horowitz explained what it takes being a CEO, an entrepreneur, a startup founder. All of this is tacite knowledge, is knowledge based on experience, on hard failures, on sleepless nights... knowledge you can't learn from books. Ben Horowitz tries hard to give you tips on how to handle difficult CEO/entrepreneur situations. And at the end, you become a CEO by being a CEO.
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MtKnUEvrL._SX336_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100"> |[Empowered](https://www.amazon.com/EMPOWERED-Ordinary-Extraordinary-Products-Silicon/dp/111969129X) , Marty Cagan, Chris jones , ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |This is my fifth audiobook. A couple of month ago, I read the book "Inspired" from Marty Cagan. (see above in this list). It literally "inspired" me, so I was curious to know if this one will "empower" me. I have to admit that even if it was an audiobook, it has been a longer journey than expected: it was not always as interesting than "Inspired". Nevertheless, This book contains lots of knowledge on what is needed to created empowered teams: a team of missionaries and not mercenaries as Marty Cagan says. As a today's leader, you need to create the structure and the processes to "empower" individuals in an organisation.   
| <img src="https://media.s-bol.com/jqBDwwV4ALj4/521x840.jpg" width="100"> |[Socrates op Sneakers](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/socrates-op-sneakers/9300000027557216/?c2a=buy#productTitle) , Elke Wiss , ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This is my sixth audiobook. I just don't get bored of this way of getting knowledge. Again, I listened to this book because it was named as one of the best personal development book to be read. And again...I'm really glad I read it. Elke Wiss explains what is important to ask "real" questions that drive "real" discussions. She explains in a practical way why this happens not enough in our society full of "quick opinions" and constraints. A refreshing book that encourage you to think.
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4112wu-v+cL._SX326_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100"> |[Escaping the build trap](https://www.bol.com/nl/nl/p/escaping-the-build-trap/9200000072521371/?Referrer=ADVNLGOO002008M-LEJ2HKYTVQLE2-537319515025&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1pG58c-I8wIVTAGLCh2OTwEDEAAYASAAEgIjJfD_BwE) , Melissa Perri , ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This is my seventh audiobook. This time, my ex-colleague Oran Cohen, a great product manager btw, recommended me this book.  What a book!!! Like the book of Marty Cagan, this book is really inspiring. It points out why so-called product organisation doesn't succeed to create "great products" and how to remediate to this. For me, this book is a must read for all product managers, board members of product companies and also product developers.

So many good advices but also thought regarding the human nature. A must read book that will serve you all your life!
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41XTBJ+t7fL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100"> |[The 5AM Club](https://www.amazon.com/AM-Club-Morning-Elevate-Life/dp/1443456624), Robin Sharma , ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | This is my eigth audiobook that I put in here (I've read other things in between ;-)). I've enjoyed this book. There are some nice things but personally I found it too lengthy and sometimes too "floaty". I've tried to wake up at 5AM and do the 20-20-20 for one week. It was tough. In my case I have to go to bed very early if I want to be able to function. I'm trying to wake up at 5h45 and if I can succeed in this challenge I will be glad.
| <img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51A028BIc0L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" width="100"> |[The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509), Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford, ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | I really like this book. For me who has been working in the IT field for 2 decades, it almost feels like an autobiography. ;-) My key takeaways about this book: 1. Repetition creates habits, and habits are what enables mastery. Whether you’re talking about sports training, learning a musical instrument, or training in the Special Forces, nothing is more important for mastery than practice and drills. Studies have shown that practicing five minutes daily is better than practicing once a week for three hours. And if you want to create a genuine culture of improvement, you must create those habits. 2. Be creative and disruptive when looking at a problem. Try not to solve it but smash it! It requires hard thinking work but in the end, it really pays off!

The author describes the components that are needed to be set to create a data driven organisation. It is less deploying a set of tools than creating a culture.
| <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51lywfyz4uL.jpg" width="100"> |[The Courage to Be Disliked](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1501197274), Ichiro Kishimi, ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | To be described...
