# Introduction
This page contains an overview of books that I have read and/or are planning to read.

I love reading and I'm disappointed that I don't have (take) time to read more. When I started with my own company in 2007, I realised that you have to learn your entire life if you want to progress. "Progress" doesn't mean to be the best, it means to gain new insights, to sense the world better.
Next to the many online courses, continuously reading is big part of my lifelong learning journey. 

The ratings below are my personal ratings, based on how I experienced the book and how relevant it is to my day-to-day life.

It starts by developping a strategy that provides a clear vision, business goals to achieve, needs to be fulfilled for specific customers segments. In its early stage, the strategy is based on many assumptions. It is important to devote time with the team to validate those assumptions. After these research this could led to pivoting or even stopping. When the strategy is clear and product performance KPI have been defined, a product roadmap is defined. This product roadmap is a high level plan on how to achieve the strategy defined. Then the product backlog can be defined with epics and items to the realisation of the product. Each tool has a link and impact each other but should not be tightly as it reduces their flexibility. Depending on the level of uncertainties (product, market, technology, business model...), those tools should be worked out until the highest level of certainty and reviewed constantly with the knowledge acuqired along the journey. Fail/change fast is the motto here. Roman provides also in his book lots of useful template, tools and techniques to help a product owner/manager during this journey. Important is to go outside, to let you help by a multidisciplinary team and to remain objective.
