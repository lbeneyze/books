# Introduction
This page contains an overview of books that I have read and/or are planning to read.

I love reading and I'm disappointed that I don't have (take) time to read more. When I started with my own company in 2007, I realised that you have to learn your entire life if you want to progress. "Progress" doesn't mean to be the best, it means to gain new insights, to sense the world better.
Next to the many online courses, continuously reading is big part of my lifelong learning journey. 

The ratings below are my personal ratings, based on how I experienced the book and how relevant it is to my day-to-day life.

# Contribute

I'm reading books about: Product management, Software architecture, management and entrepreunarial skills in general.
